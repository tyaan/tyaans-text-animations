# My Reusable Text Animation Components!

A place to store all my text animation components I've made for easy use in new projects.

## Text Animations

- PushTextUp

On hover, hover text comes up from underneath and pushes initial text up and out. 

- PushLettersUp

Same as push text up but with staggered timing on letters. 

- PushTextUpMulti

Timed carousel type thing that rotates through a list of texts, each one pushing up from underneath. 

- PushLettersUpMulti

Same as PushTextUpMulti but with staggered timing on letters. 

- PushLettersSideMulti

Same as PushLettersUpMulti but letters go off to the left instead of up. 

- UnderlineAcross

On mouse enter, underline comes left to right, one mouse leave, underline goes right to left. 

- UnderlineAcrossNoGlitch

Same as UnderlineAcross, but uses different mechanics so it doesn't glitch when you mouse enter and mouse leave quickly. 

- UnderlineMidOut

Pretty self explanatory, underline appears from middle out on hover.
